CHALLENGE - Find better ways to save lives and prevent economic losses through mechanism to predict, prevent or manage the impact of natural disasters.
IDEA - 
Work on the movable road dividers that dynamically moves as per the demand of the traffic. 
The ratio of the lanes can be predicted through the trends as per the weekends and the weekdays. 
The trends can be trained on the datas, as per the office timings in the morning and evening including lunch timings, adding that the traffic unit can also have the controls of the same for changing the number of lanes.
The trends should also predict the ratio of lanes on holidays as well as other special occasions.
The divders can move and change the ratio of the lanes. 
for example the 6 lane road has a 3:3 lane for both the directions,  
the movable dividers  can fulfill  the demand by implemention  of hypothesis and predicitability by the traffic police and appropriate algorithms.
thus to provide a dynamic  traffic system  which  will  lead for  time saving  and less accidental issues.
These system can provide more dynamic and better solution for traffic issues and can help in dealing with disasters and appropriate ways for emergency vechicles such as fire brigade and ambulance.
